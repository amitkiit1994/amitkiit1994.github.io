# amitkumar-das.com
Hello there! I built this website with plain HTML and CSS to network and have a place to blog my personal stuffs.
The site is currently hosted at two places:
1. Github pages - https://amitkiit1994.github.io./
2. My Domain - https://amitkumar-das.com/

# How to deploy this ?
It's just one step => Open the index.html file in any browser

# What's inside it ?
It's plain static website with a little bit of following:
1. HTML - index.html file has all the elements
2. CSS - for styling, find it in style.css
3. Javascript and JQuery - for little bit of coding, inside formValidateBootstrap.js and whatsapp.js
4. Bootstrap - for those beautiful web components, you will find the scripts and link in the start of the index.html
5. PHP - for server side mail function, find this in mail_handler.php

# How to host your website in Github ?
https://pages.github.com/
Note: GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesnâ€™t support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python.

# How to host it in a domain ?
1. Buy a domain (I bought from https://in.godaddy.com/, Godaddy also helps with website builders trial for the first month, so you can have your site running without actually building it)
2. Buy a web hosting service (Check out https://www.milesweb.in/, I used this to host)
3. Update your web hosting service with your domain
4. Route your Domain to web hosting service's nameserver
5. Search for file management option
6. Drop your files under a folder named public_html (usually you will find this under a folder named with your domain)
7. Thats it! Check your website up and running
