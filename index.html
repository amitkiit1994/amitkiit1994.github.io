                            <p>Once in a interview, the interviewer humiliated me in the best way. I still remember he
                                said "How have you come this far, you know nothing".
                                Next day I cleared all the rounds of Paytm.</p>

                            <p>So it reaffirms that if you have faith in yourself, nothing can stop you.</p>

                            <p>P.S: Sometimes, I think all the companies should have their employees go through a

                                for the right candidate or sometimes favorism they forget to respect the candidates.</p>

                                But in the course of giving interviews, I have learnt that we need to be vocal about our
                                thought process, because the interviewer doesn't know whats going in our mind. We need
                                to walk them through every possiblities and difficulties that we are going through in
                                the course of solving the problem statement.
                                In this way I think we can have a better chance of getting selected.</p>

                            <p>Seeing continuos success posts everyday on linkedin I started getting demotivated because
                                of my repeated failures and rejection in Interviews. So I stepped forward today to share
                                what happened before I got offers from #paytm , #ola, #jio and #microsoft. </p>

                            <p>These are the number of times I faced rejection within a span of 5 months:</p>

                            <p>One thing that remained constant throughout was determination.</p>

                            <p>So this is to everyone out there who are in the journey of giving Interviews, just hang
                                in there a little bit, because you are closer to the goal than you think.

                            <p>There might be times when you think you have finally achieved your goal, yet you failed.
                                For eg. You attempted all the rounds of an Interview & got rejected at Hiring manager
                                round/HR round.</p>

                            <p>This doesn't mean a failure, this is actually a good example of a bad day.
                                When you are in the journey of giving Interviews, you are going to face a concept which
                                I say good days and bad days. Good days are typically when in an interview you are asked
                                the basic or easiest questions and there, you get selected! But do not get surprised or
                                feel strange because your bad day was compensated here.</p>

                            <p>So remember to leverage the advantage of good days. On a bad day, when you have given
                                your best and even then you have been rejected, you should then apply to minimum 10 jobs
                                that particular night.
                                Trust me, one of the next in line will probably be your next company!</p>

                            <p>None of you hardwork is getting wasted. Every sweat counts.</p>

                            <p>One of the lessons I learned in college -</p>

                            <p>With no prior knowledge about the new lucrative dual degree program, I joined
                                B.Tech+M.Tech with an investment of 5 years of dedicated time.
                                However, in the 7th semester, we were given a choice to opt-out from the dual degree
                                program and switch to B.Tech 4 year program.
                                I wanted to grab this chance but couldn't because of 4 backlogs on my plate. Most of the
                                companies didn't allow students with backlogs to appear for assessments.
                                Guess what, except for 10 students the whole batch switched to the B.Tech 4 year
                                program, eligible for placements that year, and most of them were placed in good
                                companies.
                                I couldn't. The only thing I did was congratulate everyone for their placements.
                                And finally, after 1 year i.e. at the end of my 5th year, I was able to get an offer
                                from one of the mass recruiters.</p>

                            <p>I never took engineering seriously, I would fail in most of the exams. My negligence to
                                semester exams cost me a whole year. My batchmates have 2 more years of experience than
                                me.</p>

                            <p>I understood the importance of learning & growing in my professional years. I decided
                                not to look back and gave my best to get skilled. Better late than never but I paid for
                                my negligence.</p>

                            <p>Failures are helpful but negligence is ought to be paid. Please do not take your college
                                days for granted. Invest your time wisely!</p>

                            <p>What is the hardest part of Job hunting?</p>

                            <p>-> Preparations - No</p>

                            <p>-> Interviews - Maybe</p>

                            <p>-> Getting shortlisted - Yes! Definitely Yes.</p>

                            <p>How to get shortlisted?</p>

                            <p>1. Use resume keyword scanners: Yes, this is your first step, pick your latest resume,
                                run a scan against your desired job description. Figure out the mismatch in skills and
                                update accordingly.</p>

                            <p>2. Referrals: Yes, it is one of the approaches but you should refrain from requesting
                                referrals like "Please refer me to your company." Instead, I suggest taking your time,
                                identify the job requirements and job IDs you find yourself fit for, prepare a cover
                                letter as to why you think you are a suitable match, help out the referrer with the job
                                id, strike a conversation with the referrer where you pitch yourself the best way
                                possible, Gain trust.</p>
                            <p>Why am I saying this? You have worked hard in your preparations, you just have to put
                                that
                                last mile of
                                effort.</p>

                            <p>3. Approaching Recruiters/Hiring Managers: This is one of the best ways. But the
                                question is do you stand out from the crowd? Identify the job requirements and their IDs
                                you find yourself a fit for, start showing your proof of concepts/personal projects.
                                Prepare a cover letter stating how you are the best fit, be presentable, engage in a
                                good conversation, and build trust.</p>

                            <p>How do you think you should start job hunting?</p>

                            <p>+ Search for Jobs you want to apply for, and carefully go through the job descriptions.
                                Identify the skills and technologies that are required, you will find that most of the
                                things are similar across other job positions too. Understanding and upskilling to
                                trending industry requirements is the most important aspect of job hunting.</p>

                            <p>+ Reserve time for the next 1-2 months, to go through all the techs and skills that you
                                are missing. Once you have gained ample amount of knowledge, try to implement these as a
                                part of POCs to your current project or maybe create personal projects so that you can
                                showcase them to hiring managers.</p>

                            <p>+ Revise your already known skills thoroughly! Get your fundamentals right! In
                                interviews, you might not want to say that 'I don't have that idea because other teams
                                were handling that part', you might invest time in knowing every aspect of engineering
                                the software goes through.</p>

                            <p>+ Voila, Go for Job Applications!

                            <p>Note: This doesn't mean, you shouldn't go for interviews in the course of preparing
                                because you never know when the time is right. Having this mentality to be interview
                                ready always is the best thing, it's because opportunities may come by chance you don't
                                wanna lose them. Always take the risk, there are two sides to risk either positive or
                                negative, but the best part is you are gaining experience and that’s gonna remain
                                constant throughout your journey.</p>
