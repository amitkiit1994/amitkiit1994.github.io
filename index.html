                            <p>Once in a interview, the interviewer humiliated me in the best way. I still remember
                                he
                                said "How have you come this far, you know nothing".

                            <p>P.S: Sometimes, I think all the companies should have their employees go through a

                                for the right candidate or sometimes favorism they forget to respect the candidates.

                                the problem statement and deal with challenges within me.
                                But in the course of giving interviews, I have learnt that we need to be vocal about
                                our
                                thought process, because the interviewer doesn't know whats going in our mind. We
                                need
                                to walk them through every possiblities and difficulties that we are going through

                            <p>So this is to everyone out there who are in the journey of giving Interviews, just
                                hang
                                in there a little bit, because you are closer to the goal than you think.

                            <p>There might be times when you think you have finally achieved your goal, yet you
                                failed.
                                For eg. You attempted all the rounds of an Interview & got rejected at Hiring
                                manager
                                round/HR round.</p>

                            <p>This doesn't mean a failure, this is actually a good example of a bad day.
                                When you are in the journey of giving Interviews, you are going to face a concept
                                which
                                I say good days and bad days. Good days are typically when in an interview you are
                                asked
                                the basic or easiest questions and there, you get selected! But do not get surprised
                                or
                                feel strange because your bad day was compensated here.</p>

                            <p>So remember to leverage the advantage of good days. On a bad day, when you have given
                                your best and even then you have been rejected, you should then apply to minimum 10
                                jobs
                                that particular night.
                                Trust me, one of the next in line will probably be your next company!</p>

                            <p>None of you hardwork is getting wasted. Every sweat counts.</p>

                            <p>One of the lessons I learned in college -</p>

                            <p>With no prior knowledge about the new lucrative dual degree program, I joined
                                B.Tech+M.Tech with an investment of 5 years of dedicated time.
                                However, in the 7th semester, we were given a choice to opt-out from the dual degree
                                program and switch to B.Tech 4 year program.
                                I wanted to grab this chance but couldn't because of 4 backlogs on my plate. Most of
                                the
                                companies didn't allow students with backlogs to appear for assessments.
                                Guess what, except for 10 students the whole batch switched to the B.Tech 4 year
                                program, eligible for placements that year, and most of them were placed in good
                                companies.
                                I couldn't. The only thing I did was congratulate everyone for their placements.
                                And finally, after 1 year i.e. at the end of my 5th year, I was able to get an offer
                                from one of the mass recruiters.</p>

                            <p>I never took engineering seriously, I would fail in most of the exams. My negligence
                                to
                                semester exams cost me a whole year. My batchmates have 2 more years of experience
                                than
                                me.</p>

                            <p>I understood the importance of learning & growing in my professional years. I decided
                                not to look back and gave my best to get skilled. Better late than never but I paid
                                for
                                my negligence.</p>

                            <p>Failures are helpful but negligence is ought to be paid. Please do not take your
                                college
                                days for granted. Invest your time wisely!</p>

                            <p>What is the hardest part of Job hunting?</p>

                            <p>-> Preparations - No</p>

                            <p>-> Interviews - Maybe</p>

                            <p>-> Getting shortlisted - Yes! Definitely Yes.</p>

                            <p>How to get shortlisted?</p>

                            <p>1. Use resume keyword scanners: Yes, this is your first step, pick your latest
                                resume,
                                run a scan against your desired job description. Figure out the mismatch in skills
                                and
                                update accordingly.</p>

                            <p>2. Referrals: Yes, it is one of the approaches but you should refrain from requesting
                                referrals like "Please refer me to your company." Instead, I suggest taking your
                                time,
                                identify the job requirements and job IDs you find yourself fit for, prepare a cover
                                letter as to why you think you are a suitable match, help out the referrer with the
                                job
                                id, strike a conversation with the referrer where you pitch yourself the best way
                                possible, Gain trust.</p>
                            <p>Why am I saying this? You have worked hard in your preparations, you just have to put
                                that
                                last mile of
                                effort.</p>

                            <p>3. Approaching Recruiters/Hiring Managers: This is one of the best ways. But the
                                question is do you stand out from the crowd? Identify the job requirements and their
                                IDs
                                you find yourself a fit for, start showing your proof of concepts/personal projects.
                                Prepare a cover letter stating how you are the best fit, be presentable, engage in a
                                good conversation, and build trust.</p>

                            <p>+ Search for Jobs you want to apply for, and carefully go through the job
                                descriptions.
                                Identify the skills and technologies that are required, you will find that most of
                                the
                                things are similar across other job positions too. Understanding and upskilling to
                                trending industry requirements is the most important aspect of job hunting.</p>

                            <p>+ Reserve time for the next 1-2 months, to go through all the techs and skills that
                                you
                                are missing. Once you have gained ample amount of knowledge, try to implement these
                                as a
                                part of POCs to your current project or maybe create personal projects so that you
                                can
                                showcase them to hiring managers.</p>

                            <p>+ Revise your already known skills thoroughly! Get your fundamentals right! In
                                interviews, you might not want to say that 'I don't have that idea because other
                                teams
                                were handling that part', you might invest time in knowing every aspect of
                                engineering
                                the software goes through.</p>

                            <p>+ Voila, Go for Job Applications!</p>

                            <p>Note: This doesn't mean, you shouldn't go for interviews in the course of preparing
                                because you never know when the time is right. Having this mentality to be interview
                                ready always is the best thing, it's because opportunities may come by chance you
                                don't
                                wanna lose them. Always take the risk, there are two sides to risk either positive
                                or
                                negative, but the best part is you are gaining experience and that’s gonna remain
                                constant throughout your journey.</p>

                            <p>My Biggest Downfall in Life:</p>

                            <p>At the beginning of my career, I owned the notion of working really hard with minimal
                                leaves will result in great work opportunities. Work-life balance just did not exist
                                for
                                me.</p>

                            <p>I only took 2 trips to my home in 2 years span juggling between sprint stories and
                                meeting deadlines, barely knowing what misfortune is planned ahead.</p>

                            <p>23-03-2019:</p>

                            <p>Got an offer from SAS.</p>

                            <p>Maa was so happy and excited when I shared this news. She couldn't believe I got such
                                an
                                exclusive offer from a reputed organization. She was ecstatic and extremely proud of
                                me,
                                I couldn't help but immediately decided to bring her to my place as soon as I join
                                the
                                new organization.</p>

                            <p>24-04-2019:</p>

                            <p>Uncle: You need to come to Kolkata right now!!</p>

                            <p>Me: Why? What happened?</p>
                            <p>Uncle: I don't know how to say this - maa is no more.</p>
                            <p>Me: What? How? Where is she?</p>
                            <p>Uncle: It's cardiac arrest, we lost her.</p>

                            <p>That's it, a phone call changed my life. I was devastated, I was in shock for a week.
                                I
                                did not know what is happening and how to overcome this. I always used to talk to
                                her
                                all the time about everything. My whole world revolved around her, my joy, sorrow,
                                everything I used to share with her. I could not feel anything emotionally.</p>

                            <p>After a while, it struck me, What about the switch? that is still pending to deal
                                with.
                                I was dwelling on whether I should switch because I wouldn't be able to perform due
                                to
                                the depression and hardship I was dealing whereas if I stay, I would have time to
                                cope
                                up with the tragic reality, people may understand even if I mess up. A gazillion
                                amount
                                of emotions and questions were clouding my mind yet no answers.</p>

                            <p>Another thought that dawned upon me was that I know I couldn't perform or do
                                anything,
                                my conscience cease to exist, everything was at pause for me now but the world is
                                not
                                going to stop for me or anyone, it just moves on despite whatever is happening
                                around.
                                Hence the phrase 'Business As Usual.</p>

                            <p>So I decided and made the switch and it turned out to be one of the best decisions in
                                my
                                life.</p>

                            <p>My journey within SAS transformed me into a different person, the kind of people I
                                worked with, the mindset, it changed me as a whole. I grew technically,
                                professionally,
                                and in all aspects. All of this was the result of the right decision and the
                                wonderful
                                team I was working with.</p>

                            <p>I finally understood that we are going to face a lot of hardships in life, but we
                                should
                                not consider it as an excuse to step back instead we should take the risk, get it
                                together, have self-belief, and step forward. Trust me, we are going to bounce back
                                stronger than before.</p>

                            <p>Work-life balance is an important thing. Acknowledge your loved ones before your
                                work.
                                Do not take them for granted, invest your time with your family, create memories
                                with
                                them because your work is going to stay, and remember, you are always replaceable!

                            <p>I got my first job offer through on-campus placements and I was hired by a mass
                                recruiter.</p>

                            <p>So when I started thinking about a switch, that was around 2 years in corporate life.
                                I
                                started preparing and giving interviews. Even with a good prep (at least I thought
                                so),
                                I was failing every Interview in the first round itself and I continued losing hope
                                thinking "Will I ever be able to crack any interview?"</p>

                            <p>After a while, I started writing down all the questions that were asked during the
                                interview and kept the question bank updated whenever I was asked any new questions.
                            </p>

                            <p>Guess what, that note still works wonders for me!</p>

                            <p>I know you will find a lot of interview questions out there online and you can easily
                                get the most asked ones, but still, I recommend after every interview, make a note
                                of
                                every question that was asked, additionally I also keep track of how I answered and
                                how
                                the experience was.
                                Trust me this will help in the long run.</p>

                            <p>Why should you track?</p>
                            <p>Firstly, it will help you in your future interviews and then think about this, your
                                life
                                is a journey, and every individual will have different experiences in different
                                situations. So how wonderful will it be when you look back and find how you were and
                                how
                                much you have grown now?</p>

                            <p>You are always a better version today than you were yesterday.</p>

                            <p>We all have a common skill - Problem Solving.</p>
                            <p>Every time you face a challenge in life, you work for it real hard and overcome it.
                                Have you ever wondered? How much do you exercise your mind to solve the problem? How
                                much time and effort did you put in dedicated to cross that mark? How many hits and
                                trials do you make? How do you think about negative scenarios?</p>

                            <p>I believe we all are solving algorithms every second in our life. So can I say- for
                                software engineers, Problem Solving is programmatically projecting those thoughts or
                                algorithms in a code?
                                Now, if you think you are not good at problem-solving. Think again, the only thing
                                you
                                are missing is a routine practice.</p>

                            <p>I suggest from today, don't let DSA scare you instead try solving 2-3 problems daily
                                because DSA will make things easier for you.
                                Start with the easiest ones, let your mind get trained and gradually you will be
                                able to
                                solve difficult ones easily. It's because you just need practice for what you
                                already do
                                every day!</p>

                            <p>You are closer to your goals than you expect. Keep your spirits high!</p>

                            <p>This happened to me:</p>

                            <p>1. When I saw my mom in tears when I gifted her a pendant with my initial earnings.
                            </p>

                            <p>2. When I cleared my college entrance examination.</p>

                            <p>3. When I saw myself in the Infosys Candidate Selection List in my placements.</p>

                            <p>4. When I cleared the final interview round of my dream company.</p>

                            <p>...</p>

                            <p>The scene portrayed in the final scene of the movie 'The Pursuit of Happyness' is
                                real.
                                We all can relate to it with at least one incident in our lives where we worked so
                                hard
                                to get the thing done.
                                With the right amount of passion, determination, self-motivation, and smart work,
                                anything you dream of can be turned into reality because with this combo you are
                                ought
                                to get lucky for real.</p>

                            <p>For me in one of the incidents, I started dreaming of getting into big techs when
                                every
                                alternate post on LinkedIn started with "Happy to share I joined #faang" and the
                                struggle started with "Print prime numbers from 1-100" .....</p>

                            <p>Like everyone, a lot of things came into mind then:</p>
                            <p>1. Is there a future in Testing?</p>
                            <p>2. Will I be able to grow?</p>
                            <p>3. Am I gonna get paid less than the developers?</p>
                            <p>4. Will I be able to code?</p>
                            <p>5. Will I only be clicking and verifying UI all my life?</p>

                            <p>Today, when I look back I feel happy and blessed that these points did not count and

                                Don't
                                let a role or designation stop you from upskilling. We can continue to learn and
                                grow in
                                different fields irrespective of our day job. And when the time is right, we make

                                move.</p>

                            <p>You are always more capable than you expect yourself to be. Let's challenge and take
