                                call
                                from the recruiter. I am pretty frank here and the toughest part of getting into big
                                techs is getting a call from them, but let me tell you this that shouldn&apos;t stop
                                you
                                from applying. I have more than thirty job applications on amazon that are in the
                                archived state before I got a call from them.</p>
                            <p>In the case of Microsoft, I was approached by a Microsoft employee who had a strong
                                feeling about my LinkedIn profile, he had a gut feeling about me eventually he
                                approached me to check if I was looking for a job in SDET and willing to work for
                                Microsoft. Trust me, I wasn&apos;t looking for a change at that time it&apos;s
                                because I
                                had recently switched from SAS to JIO and it was only three months since the switch
                                but
                                at the same time I couldn&apos;t say no to the opportunity. So that&apos;s how it
                                all
                                started but little did I know all of the fun was about to be two months long,</p>
                            <p>So as soon as I nodded yes the employee from Microsoft referred me and my job
                                application
                                was processed, I was excited to start the interview process and started my
                                preparations
                                for it. I had always heard of Microsoft interviews and I was scared by reading all
                                the
                                leet code reviews. Trust me reading those interview experiences I was only getting
                                demotivated, but also in the back of my mind, I kept my spirits high and was praying
                                for
                                luck to favor me. It&apos;s true that no matter how much genius you are and how well
                                you
                                are prepared if luck doesn&apos;t favor you then you are eventually gonna fail but
                                it&apos;s also true that luck favors only those who do honest hard work and trust me
                                I
                                worked really hard for the interview.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>So the good part about luck favoring me was the time I had for preparations was about
                                a
                                month-long. It started with an initial intimation from the recruiter where I was
                                required to put in my preferred dates of interview, this was the first communication
                                after my referral was processed and this took around a week after the referral
                                happened.
                                After this, I was pretty sure that my resume was shortlisted and the next thing will
                                be
                                the scary interviews. So I waited for about a week, then I received an online
                                assessment
                                link.</p>
                            <p><strong>Online Assessment</strong></p>
                            <p>The online assessment was full of ISQTB questions of foundation level and it had one
                                coding question it was a simple array question.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp;Once done with the online assessment, I was confident about my answers and I
                                started preparing for the next round which was technical. &nbsp;So I figured out
                                that
                                the waiting period must be one week within the interviews, but I was wrong, I kept
                                waiting weeks after weeks but there was no revert from the recruiter. I got puzzled,
                                confused, anxious, I mailed the recruitment team, I went back to the referrer, I
                                tried
                                contacting every way possible but I was not getting a satisfactory reply and I
                                couldn&apos;t gulp the fact that I was rejected in the online assessment, by the
                                third
                                week I lost all the hope but through these days I never stopped preparing, and
                                eventually, by the end of the third week I got a call from one of the recruiters and
                                I
                                got my first round scheduled.</p>
                            <p><strong>Techincal Round -1</strong></p>
                            <p>In technical round 1, I was interviewed by a Consultant where he gave me some
                                three-four
                                coding questions revolving around strings, arrays, hashmaps, etc. &nbsp;The
                                questions
                                are mostly from GFG, its related to building magic arrays out of a pre-existing
                                array,
                                subarray out of a given array with criteria, sub sequenced string out of the given
                                string with criteria, some sliding window techniques, etc. There were no graphs,
                                trees,
                                etc. Then he asked me questions related to testing fundamentals, like how to design
                                a
                                document for exit criteria, entry criteria, bug lifecycle, etc. Then came the core
                                part,
                                he asked me to design ten end-to-end test cases for youtube which was a good method
                                to
                                evaluate testing skills. In the end, all questions were related to automation tools
                                like
                                API testing, Selenium, Frameworks, etc.</p>
                            <p>Once done with the tech 1 round, I was pretty confident that I would be clearing it
                                because I was happy with my performance. So again I resumed my preparations and
                                after a
                                week I received a call from the recruiter and got the technical 2 round scheduled.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Techincal Round -2</strong></p>
                            <p>It&apos;s similar to the technical 1 round, as usual, he was asking me some series of
                                coding questions which were easy not too tough but yes you have to put your mind
                                through
                                it to solve it at the place. Then he asked me some testing fundamentals, and then he
                                gave me a scenario and wanted to me write 100% testing coverage test cases for it
                                with a
                                testing technique. I couldn&apos;t do it, so he asked me what are testing
                                techniques? I
                                followed with boundary testing and then he suggested using decision testing. I
                                couldn&apos;t do it so he explained what is decision testing and how to approach it,
                                I
                                understood it and was able to come up with some satisfactory test cases. Then in the
                                end
                                he asked me to write some complex xpaths and selenium tool related questions.</p>
                            <p>Trust me, I was not sure about this round since my performance was kind of okayish.
                                So I
                                was scared but still expecting a positive result, and it happened so my luck was by
                                my
                                side and after a week I got a call and was able to schedule my Technical Handson
                                Round.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Technical Hands-on Round</strong></p>
                            <p>In this round, I was asked to keep a pre-setup ready with all the tools required for
                                automation. It was 2 hour-long interview, I was scared to death because automating
                                UI is
                                kind of a risky job because you are confident that it will run but it doesn&apos;t
                                run
                                smooth. I hate UI automation, I was praying if I get an API automation scenario but
                                just
                                as so the opposite happened, I was given 3-4 test cases of one scenario to automate
                                from
                                UI for a Microsoft web product and a medium level coding question which was related
                                to
                                finding the combination of strings. I tried automating the scenario and solved the
                                coding question but guess what the automation was partially executing and most of
                                the
                                test cases for the coding question were failing. So nothing was working fine within
                                that
                                2hours span, but I had a hell of a lot of robust good quality code which I was proud
                                of.
                                Eventually in the end when there was code pairing with the interviewer, he asked me
                                to
                                solve some problems and change some logic and some exceptions to handle which I was
                                able
                                to come up with. Then he asked me to send the code to him.</p>
                            <p>I was devastated after it was over. I couldn&apos;t believe that my dream was getting
                                faded. None of the things worked as I expected it to work. Eventually that day
                                afternoon
                                I couldn&apos;t wait for revert and I made the call to the recruiter and I
                                couldn&apos;t
                                believe what she had to say. She said &apos;Yes&apos;. Trust me I couldn&apos;t stop
                                crying after I dropped the call, I cried out loud because it happened and I had a
                                final
                                round with the Hiring manager scheduled that day evening.</p>
                            <p><strong>Hiring Manager Round</strong></p>
                            <p>This is the easiest one, just management questions. All though there was one question
                                which I had to speak about a little longer I still remember the question &quot;Is
                                Kubernetes similar to listeners interface?&quot; I gave a lot of theories and
                                possibilities and was diplomatic throughout but in the end, I went for No. I still
                                don&apos;t know what should have been the correct answer but doesn&apos;t matter,
                                its
                                because I knew the intent of the question was to evaluate if my concepts about
                                Kubernetes is strong and I knew I was strong in Kubernetes its because whenever I
                                read
                                about or learn a new skill I try to read the architecture diagram because
                                that&apos;s
                                how you can have your fundamentals clear.</p>
                            <p>After two weeks I got a call from the recruiter to send me the documents. So this how
                                it
                                all happened.</p>

                                But in the course of giving interviews, I have learnt that we need to be vocal
                                about
                                our

                                For eg. You attempted all the rounds of an Interview & got rejected at Hiring
                                manager
                                round/HR round.</p>

                            <p>This doesn't mean a failure, this is actually a good example of a bad day.
                                When you are in the journey of giving Interviews, you are going to face a
                                concept
                                which
                                I say good days and bad days. Good days are typically when in an interview you
                                are
                                asked
                                the basic or easiest questions and there, you get selected! But do not get
                                surprised
                                or
                                feel strange because your bad day was compensated here.</p>

                            <p>So remember to leverage the advantage of good days. On a bad day, when you have
                                given
                                your best and even then you have been rejected, you should then apply to minimum
                                10
                                jobs
                                that particular night.
                                Trust me, one of the next in line will probably be your next company!</p>

                            <p>2. Do not compare.</p>
                            <p>3. Staying motivated is the key</p>
                            <p>4. Adapt yourself to the current organization, try to dwell in, stay patient.</p>
                            <p>5. Be content and try not to lose your focus.</p>
                            <p>6. First few weeks are going to be hard, be prepared to stretch yourself.</p>
                            <p>7. Lastly, prevail your skills.</p>

                            <p>One of the lessons I learned in college -</p>

                            <p>With no prior knowledge about the new lucrative dual degree program, I joined
                                B.Tech+M.Tech with an investment of 5 years of dedicated time.
                                However, in the 7th semester, we were given a choice to opt-out from the dual
                                degree
                                program and switch to B.Tech 4 year program.
                                I wanted to grab this chance but couldn't because of 4 backlogs on my plate.
                                Most of
                                the
                                companies didn't allow students with backlogs to appear for assessments.
                                Guess what, except for 10 students the whole batch switched to the B.Tech 4 year
                                program, eligible for placements that year, and most of them were placed in good
                                companies.
                                I couldn't. The only thing I did was congratulate everyone for their placements.
                                And finally, after 1 year i.e. at the end of my 5th year, I was able to get an
                                offer
                                from one of the mass recruiters.</p>

                            <p>I never took engineering seriously, I would fail in most of the exams. My
                                negligence
                                to
                                semester exams cost me a whole year. My batchmates have 2 more years of
                                experience
                                than
                                me.</p>

                            <p>I understood the importance of learning & growing in my professional years. I
                                decided
                                not to look back and gave my best to get skilled. Better late than never but I
                                paid
                                for
                                my negligence.</p>

                            <p>Failures are helpful but negligence is ought to be paid. Please do not take your
                                college
                                days for granted. Invest your time wisely!</p>

                            <p>What is the hardest part of Job hunting?</p>

                            <p>-> Preparations - No</p>

                            <p>-> Interviews - Maybe</p>

                            <p>-> Getting shortlisted - Yes! Definitely Yes.</p>

                            <p>How to get shortlisted?</p>

                            <p>1. Use resume keyword scanners: Yes, this is your first step, pick your latest
                                resume,
                                run a scan against your desired job description. Figure out the mismatch in
                                skills
                                and
                                update accordingly.</p>

                            <p>2. Referrals: Yes, it is one of the approaches but you should refrain from
                                requesting
                                referrals like "Please refer me to your company." Instead, I suggest taking your
                                time,
                                identify the job requirements and job IDs you find yourself fit for, prepare a
                                cover
                                letter as to why you think you are a suitable match, help out the referrer with
                                the
                                job
                                id, strike a conversation with the referrer where you pitch yourself the best
                                way
                                possible, Gain trust.</p>
                            <p>Why am I saying this? You have worked hard in your preparations, you just have to
                                put
                                that
                                last mile of
                                effort.</p>

                            <p>3. Approaching Recruiters/Hiring Managers: This is one of the best ways. But the
                                question is do you stand out from the crowd? Identify the job requirements and
                                their
                                IDs
                                you find yourself a fit for, start showing your proof of concepts/personal
                                projects.
                                Prepare a cover letter stating how you are the best fit, be presentable, engage
                                in a
                                good conversation, and build trust.</p>

                            <p>+ Search for Jobs you want to apply for, and carefully go through the job
                                descriptions.
                                Identify the skills and technologies that are required, you will find that most

                            <p>My Biggest Downfall in Life:</p>

                            <p>At the beginning of my career, I owned the notion of working really hard with
                                minimal
                                leaves will result in great work opportunities. Work-life balance just did not
                                exist
                                for
                                me.</p>

                            <p>I only took 2 trips to my home in 2 years span juggling between sprint stories
                                and
                                meeting deadlines, barely knowing what misfortune is planned ahead.</p>

                            <p>23-03-2019:</p>

                            <p>Got an offer from SAS.</p>

                            <p>Maa was so happy and excited when I shared this news. She couldn't believe I got
                                such
                                an
                                exclusive offer from a reputed organization. She was ecstatic and extremely
                                proud of
                                me,
                                I couldn't help but immediately decided to bring her to my place as soon as I
                                join
                                the
                                new organization.</p>

                            <p>24-04-2019:</p>

                            <p>Uncle: You need to come to Kolkata right now!!</p>

                            <p>Me: Why? What happened?</p>
                            <p>Uncle: I don't know how to say this - maa is no more.</p>
                            <p>Me: What? How? Where is she?</p>
                            <p>Uncle: It's cardiac arrest, we lost her.</p>

                            <p>That's it, a phone call changed my life. I was devastated, I was in shock for a
                                week.
                                I
                                did not know what is happening and how to overcome this. I always used to talk
                                to
                                her
                                all the time about everything. My whole world revolved around her, my joy,
                                sorrow,
                                everything I used to share with her. I could not feel anything emotionally.</p>

                            <p>After a while, it struck me, What about the switch? that is still pending to deal
                                with.
                                I was dwelling on whether I should switch because I wouldn't be able to perform
                                due
                                to
                                the depression and hardship I was dealing whereas if I stay, I would have time
                                to
                                cope
                                up with the tragic reality, people may understand even if I mess up. A gazillion
                                amount
                                of emotions and questions were clouding my mind yet no answers.</p>

                            <p>Another thought that dawned upon me was that I know I couldn't perform or do
                                anything,
                                my conscience cease to exist, everything was at pause for me now but the world
                                is
                                not
                                going to stop for me or anyone, it just moves on despite whatever is happening
                                around.
                                Hence the phrase 'Business As Usual.</p>

                            <p>So I decided and made the switch and it turned out to be one of the best
                                decisions in
                                my
                                life.</p>

                            <p>My journey within SAS transformed me into a different person, the kind of people
                                I
                                worked with, the mindset, it changed me as a whole. I grew technically,
                                professionally,
                                and in all aspects. All of this was the result of the right decision and the
                                wonderful
                                team I was working with.</p>

                            <p>I finally understood that we are going to face a lot of hardships in life, but we
                                should
                                not consider it as an excuse to step back instead we should take the risk, get
                                it
                                together, have self-belief, and step forward. Trust me, we are going to bounce
                                back
                                stronger than before.</p>

                            <p>Work-life balance is an important thing. Acknowledge your loved ones before your
                                work.
                                Do not take them for granted, invest your time with your family, create memories
                                with
                                them because your work is going to stay, and remember, you are always
                                replaceable!

                            <p>I got my first job offer through on-campus placements and I was hired by a mass
                                recruiter.</p>

                            <p>So when I started thinking about a switch, that was around 2 years in corporate
                                life.
                                I
                                started preparing and giving interviews. Even with a good prep (at least I
                                thought
                                so),
                                I was failing every Interview in the first round itself and I continued losing
                                hope
                                thinking "Will I ever be able to crack any interview?"</p>

                            <p>After a while, I started writing down all the questions that were asked during
                                the
                                interview and kept the question bank updated whenever I was asked any new
                                questions.
                            </p>

                            <p>Guess what, that note still works wonders for me!</p>

                            <p>I know you will find a lot of interview questions out there online and you can
                                easily
                                get the most asked ones, but still, I recommend after every interview, make a
                                note
                                of
                                every question that was asked, additionally I also keep track of how I answered
                                and
                                how
                                the experience was.
                                Trust me this will help in the long run.</p>

                            <p>Why should you track?</p>
                            <p>Firstly, it will help you in your future interviews and then think about this,
                                your
                                life
                                is a journey, and every individual will have different experiences in different
                                situations. So how wonderful will it be when you look back and find how you were
                                and
                                how
                                much you have grown now?</p>

                            <p>You are always a better version today than you were yesterday.</p>

                            <p>We all have a common skill - Problem Solving.</p>
                            <p>Every time you face a challenge in life, you work for it real hard and overcome
                                it.
                                Have you ever wondered? How much do you exercise your mind to solve the problem?
                                How
                                much time and effort did you put in dedicated to cross that mark? How many hits
                                and
                                trials do you make? How do you think about negative scenarios?</p>

                            <p>I believe we all are solving algorithms every second in our life. So can I say-
                                for
                                software engineers, Problem Solving is programmatically projecting those
                                thoughts or
                                algorithms in a code?
                                Now, if you think you are not good at problem-solving. Think again, the only
                                thing
                                you
                                are missing is a routine practice.</p>

                            <p>I suggest from today, don't let DSA scare you instead try solving 2-3 problems
                                daily
                                because DSA will make things easier for you.
                                Start with the easiest ones, let your mind get trained and gradually you will be
                                able to
                                solve difficult ones easily. It's because you just need practice for what you
                                already do
                                every day!</p>

                            <p>You are closer to your goals than you expect. Keep your spirits high!</p>

                            <p>This happened to me:</p>

                            <p>1. When I saw my mom in tears when I gifted her a pendant with my initial
                                earnings.

                            <p>3. When I saw myself in the Infosys Candidate Selection List in my placements.
                            </p>

                            <p>4. When I cleared the final interview round of my dream company.</p>

                            <p>...</p>

                            <p>The scene portrayed in the final scene of the movie 'The Pursuit of Happyness' is
                                real.
                                We all can relate to it with at least one incident in our lives where we worked
                                so
                                hard
                                to get the thing done.
                                With the right amount of passion, determination, self-motivation, and smart
                                work,
                                anything you dream of can be turned into reality because with this combo you are
                                ought
                                to get lucky for real.</p>

                            <p>For me in one of the incidents, I started dreaming of getting into big techs when
                                every
                                alternate post on LinkedIn started with "Happy to share I joined #faang" and the
                                struggle started with "Print prime numbers from 1-100" .....</p>

                            <p>Being from a core engineering background, when I started my career as a software
                                engineer, I did not have a choice and I was put into testing stream training.
                            </p>
                            <p>Like everyone, a lot of things came into mind then:</p>
                            <p>1. Is there a future in Testing?</p>
                            <p>2. Will I be able to grow?</p>

                            <p>5. Will I only be clicking and verifying UI all my life?</p>

                            <p>Today, when I look back I feel happy and blessed that these points did not count

                            <p>It doesn't matter what role you are in, if you choose to grow, there is no limit.
                                Don't
                                let a role or designation stop you from upskilling. We can continue to learn and
                                grow in
                                different fields irrespective of our day job. And when the time is right, we
                                make
                                the
                                move.</p>

                            <p>You are always more capable than you expect yourself to be. Let's challenge and
                                take
                                a
